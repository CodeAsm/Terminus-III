# Terminus III

Terminus III or fate 3 (F3te) is a adaptation of the original Fate and Fate2 linux terminal hacking teaching program.

## About the Game

**Work in progress, features listed may not yet be available in-game**

Terminus III is designed to simulate a hacking environment where players navigate and explore a Linux system. Through this game, players can develop valuable skills that are applicable in real-world cybersecurity scenarios. Here are some of the skills you can expect to learn:

- **Linux Proficiency**: By navigating the Linux terminal, players will become more comfortable with Linux commands and file system structure.
- **Networking**: Players will learn about network protocols, how to analyze network traffic, and understand the basics of network security.
- **Infiltration Techniques**: The game introduces methods for gaining unauthorized access to systems, which helps players understand how to protect against such attacks.
- **Covering Tracks**: Players will learn techniques for hiding their activities on a system, which is crucial for understanding how to detect and prevent malicious behavior.
- **Evading Detection**: The game teaches strategies for avoiding detection by security systems, providing insight into how to improve system defenses.
- **Software Exploitation**: Players will get a basic understanding of software vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited, which is essential for both offensive and defensive security roles.

While the hacks in the game are simulated and not real, the skills acquired can be used to secure systems, understand potential threats, and improve overall cybersecurity knowledge.
